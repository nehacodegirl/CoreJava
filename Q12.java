/*12.	In a company an employee is paid as under: 
If his basic salary is less than Rs. 10000, 
then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. 
If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 10000, 
then HRA = Rs. 2000 and DA = 98% of basic salary. 
If the employee's salary is input by the user 
write a program to find his gross salary.
